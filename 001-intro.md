# Introduction

## The target audience

A computer is a magnificent thing. I want to say that I believe everyone ought to have one and maybe a large amount may be able to afford one. What may throw some people off is that they would immediately fall into a hole that they cannot climb out of - the _pitts of envy_. We would quickly enter a debate about _"Well computers these days can do X, Y and Z, so what good is talking about a decade all machine in your garage?"_.

And that's **correct**.

This is however where lines of thinking such as "we need a more inclusive computer society" and "closing the poverty gap" will seep in. Whilst they're not entirely wrong, yes a machine from a decade ago cannot run some large-language model - nevermind a low-powered one from _this_ generation but this misses the point.

This is a very materialistic and inherently envious way to look at anything, nevermind just computers. If what you are after is simply having complete computational equality where everyone has the exact same machine with the same specifications and access to all services then you'll **always** be out of luck.

I think this is not a real problem; it is only one for those who are envious.


1. Use large-language models
2. Process video and edit it in realtime
3. Watch 4K YouTube videos
4. Gaming

If any of the previous are "make or break" requirements for your computing needs then I suggest you close this book and don't buy it.

If you, like me, do have interests in what can be done with a basic computer from 2015, that Raspberry Pi you got two years ago at a conference or that TP Link router that you're about to throw into the garbage - then I can guarantee that you'll be excited to continue reading on. This book is more of a guide with running commentary. It aims to link the escoteric developments of the recent years from the world of hackers (note, I use the original meaning of hackers), of which there are many and which solve many problems, to your hardware you're about to toss out.

This _"link"_ is what is missing most of the time, great ideas and software can only be meaninfully adopted by the public if there is accompanying documentation palatable to the masses.

Now that I have succesfully pushed away potential readers whom may have thought they'd get a _"quick win"_ out of this book (i.e. tech life hacks) I can focus on those who have at the very least had their interest _piqued_. This book is therefore for people who have the following traits or are _on the cusp_ of acquiring them (I am glad to help):

1. Enjoy learning for the sake of it
2. Like creating real things with real use cases
3. Take joy in creating solutions for _Problem $X$_ instead of merely complaining that a solution does not exist


## With what few scraps of junk?


There is way more one can do with an old router that was going to be thrown out or the desktop personal computer that dad hasn't seen a need for in the last 3 years. Hell, even your smartphone - your _current_ smartphone can be put to more than just a single use case.

You'll be amazed at the potential that lies within all of these devices we've just mentioned _despite_ their rather mediocre appearances. It should come as no surpprise when you learn that was a "TP Link WR whatever...." is ibfact no different to that of your dad's abaondoned computer. These devices are different under the hood but at the end of the day, are all compyters. That means they are generic enough to perform any computational task you may have.

But what could one accomplish with this? I have seemingly just glossed over some theory stating the obvious: "Yes your home router is infact a computer", "Computers can compute anything". Realistically, stating this just informs the public that there exists a group of individuals that have the technical know-how to re-purpose these devices. **Where does that leave the layman?**

And that's totally valid to ask. Where indeed _does_ this leave the layman. We may as well continue with our lives and let computer scientists and the lot handle these things, _right?_ Well, it leaves the layman where he has always been either he has an interest and is doing what he can to learn (such as by getting this book) or he simply has no interest. This book aims to help you, the layman, understand computer hardware and software in order for you to make use of what you have laying around.

I like to think of it like this. What good are all the chemicals beneath your kitchen sink if you don't have the _Anarchist's Cookbook_? Now replace the _chemicals_ with computer hardware and the _Anarchist's Cookbook_ with this book.


\notebox{Anarchy? Chemicals? Are these not things associated with extremist groups? Well, yes, if the current norm is against those things. This does not however preclude them from being \textit{ethical} - which is one of the focus points of this book.}


The quicker you realise the potential inherent in all modern computers of the last decade and what the right guidance can provide - you shall immediately start imagining all the potential use cases for old hardware and, more importantly, be able to create something for yourself and maybe your wider community that actually makes a real impact.

I hope you enjoy this book as much I enjoyed the multiple months of research required. This book is as much a guide for you as it is for me when I was learning things that even I had not heard of before.

God bless.
