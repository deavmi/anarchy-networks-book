# Introduction

## The target audience

A computer is a magnificent thing. I want to say that I believe everyone ought to have one and maybe a large amount may be able to afford one. What may throw some people off is that they would immediately fall into a hole that they cannot climb out of - the _pitts of envy_. We would quickly enter a debate about _"Well computers these days can do X, Y and Z, so what good is talking about a decade all machine in your garage?"_.

And that's **correct**.

This is however where lines of thinking such as "we need a more inclusive computer society" and "closing the poverty gap" will seep in. Whilst they're not entirely wrong, yes a machine from a decade ago cannot run some large-language model - nevermind a low-powered one from _this_ generation but this misses the point.

This is a very materialistic and inherently envious way to look at anything, nevermind just computers. If what you are after is simply having complete computational equality where everyone has the exact same machine with the same specifications and access to all services then you'll **always** be out of luck.

I think this is not a real problem; it is only one for those who are envious.


1. Use large-language models
2. Process video and edit it in realtime
3. Watch 4K YouTube videos
4. Gaming

If any of the previous are "make or break" requirements for your computing needs then I suggest you close this book and don't buy it.

If you, like me, do have interests in what can be done with a basic computer from 2015, that Raspberry Pi you got two years ago at a conference or that TP Link router that you're about to throw into the garbage - then I can guarantee that you'll be excited to continue reading on. This book is more of a guide with running commentary. It aims to link the escoteric developments of the recent years from the world of hackers (note, I use the original meaning of hackers), of which there are many and which solve many problems, to your hardware you're about to toss out.

This _"link"_ is what is missing most of the time, great ideas and software can only be meaninfully adopted by the public if there is accompanying documentation palatable to the masses.

Now that I have succesfully pushed away potential readers whom may have thought they'd get a _"quick win"_ out of this book (i.e. tech life hacks) I can focus on those who have at the very least had their interest _piqued_. This book is therefore for people who have the following traits or are _on the cusp_ of acquiring them (I am glad to help):

1. Enjoy learning for the sake of it
2. Like creating real things with real use cases
3. Take joy in creating solutions for _Problem $X$_ instead of merely complaining that a solution does not exist



TODO: Below feels like it belongs in the next section

Yes, it does not matter whether the computer in question is not the latest edition, missing these hardware accelerators or produced in the last two years - it really does not. The quicker you realise the potential inherent in all modern computers of the last decade and what the right guidance can provide - you shall immediately start imagining all the potential use cases for old hardware and, more importantly, be able to create something for yourself and maybe your wider community that actually makes a real impact.
