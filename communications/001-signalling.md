## Long-range e-mail/remote control/SOS system

Let's think about how we could solve a few problems that fit into or rather are _constrained by_ the following:

### The constraints

#### Costs

This is the first constraint as it relates to the next one. Simply put, this should not cost an _arm and a leg_ (as the saying goes). The parts should be readily available where you are or cheaply shipped and he building procedure should not be costly. The latter normally implies it can be built with tools everyone has or can easily borrow from their neighbor.

The costs of _maintenance_ should be low as well. This refers to the operational costs as well as any fixes - normally of which should relate directly to the previous statement - the parts to be replaced should be inexpensive.

\notebox{Remember, you may be able to put some money together with members of your community who too are interested in this idea - this can help your crowdsource both personally owned devices (think of buying one for each other every month with pooled funds) \textit{or} one for the whole community to use in a co-operative/trust fashion.}

#### Low power usage

We don't want to consume a lot of electricity, period. We want a device that does not require a high-voltage and has a current draw per-hour that is not very high (meaing every hour the amount of amps pulled must be low).

This constraint allows us to consider various places of installation via various voltage sources:

* Solar energy
    * If we are able to buy a cheap solar panel that supplies the needed voltage then we can make use of what is _in effect_ free energy.
    * The even _more appealing_ aspect of solar is that it means you can place setup operation in a remote location where there is no wiring available - this allows reaching places one would never be able to do otherwise. It is not necessarily the case that one cares all too much for deploying something on a mountain top for some bushman living _there_ but rather because it may be a useful vantage point to connect people on either side of the mountain range.
* Battery operable
    * This constraint _also_ implies that one should be able to build what we shall build in a manner that it is also portable. A solar panel _can_ count here as well but is not practical when sunshine is amiss.
    * Something which can be powered off of a laptop or other sources such as ones phone or an external battery bank is a preferable solution.
